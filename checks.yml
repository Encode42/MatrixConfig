#     Hi, welcome to use Matrix checks anti-cheat, this is checks.yml, used to define
#  the settings and behaviors of each checks. You can set the parameters of
#  each check here, and you can also define how to perform actions after each
#  check detects a player cheating.
#
#  CAUTION! If you encounter any false positives and bypasses, lol
#
#  - What is "VL"?
#        "VL" is the abbreviation of "very looser"
#
#  - If you encounter any problems, please go to our official Discord
